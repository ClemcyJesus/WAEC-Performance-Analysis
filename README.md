# WAEC-Performance-Analysis
This project provides an in-depth analysis of studentsâ€™ performance in WAEC across years, subjects, states, and gender. It aims to uncover meaningful trends, evaluate academic strengths and weaknesses, and generate actionable insights that can help education stakeholders improve teaching and learning outcomes.


## Dataset Description

The dataset contains examination records with the following fields:

- State â€“ Name of the Nigerian state
- Gender â€“ Male / Female
- Year â€“ Year of examination
- Total Sat â€“ Total number of candidates who sat for WAEC
- 5 Credits (with Maths & English) â€“ Number of students with five credits including Maths and English
- 5 Credits (with Maths ) â€“ Number of students with five credits including Maths
- 5 Credits (with English) â€“ Number of students with five credits including English
- Performance (%) â€“ Percentage of students with 5 credits including Maths & English

## Dashboard Pages & Insights
### KPI Overview

- Percentage Performance: 60.72%
- Male Performance: 46.24K
- Female Performance: 52.17K
- ðŸ’¡ Insight: Female students slightly outperform males in overall performance, contributing to a higher success rate.


## Gender Trend Analysis

- Visuals show performance by year and state, comparing male and female candidates.
- Lagos, Ogun, and Rivers record the highest number of successful candidates.
- Both genders show a steady improvement trend between 2018â€“2021.
ðŸ’¡ Insight: Female performance exhibits a sharper upward trend compared to males in recent years.


## Participation vs Performance by Gender

- Male and Female participation analyzed by year and state.
- Relationship between number of candidates and those with 5 credits including Maths & English.
- Insight: States with higher participation (like Lagos and Ogun) maintain consistent performance, but participation does not always guarantee higher success rates.


  ## Tools & Technologies

- Power BI â€“ Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization
- Excel â€“ Data preparation and preprocessing
- Python - Jupiter Notebook
- DAX â€“ Used for calculated measures (e.g., percentage performance, total 5 credits)


## Key Insights

- Female students show stronger overall performance consistency.
- Lagos leads both genders in total passes and participation.
- Steady upward trend observed from 2018â€“2021 in performance rates.
- Gender parity improving â€” gap between male and female performance narrowing yearly.



 ## Recommendations

- Continue supporting female participation and STEM programs.
- Target low-performing states with tailored educational interventions.
- Maintain consistent WAEC preparation policies across all states.
